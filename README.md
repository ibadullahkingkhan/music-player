    git clone https://github.com/ibadullahkingkhan/Music-Player.git

    Open index.html in a browser.

🔧 Understanding info.json Structure

Each album or playlist folder contains an info.json file, which provides details about the playlist.
Example info.json File:

{
    "title": "Playlist Name",
    "description": "Short description"
}

    "title" → The playlist or album name displayed in the player.
    "description" → A short description of the playlist.

Additionally, every album folder should contain an image.jpg file.

    This serves as the album cover for the playlist.
    You can upload any image, but it must be named image.jpg for the player to display it correctly.

🔧 Customization

    Add new albums and songs inside the songs/ folder.
    Update info.json in each album folder to modify album details.
    Replace image.jpg with any album cover image (keep the same name).
    Customize the UI in style.css.
